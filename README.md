My updated portfolio for 2022.

Want to see my growth as a developer?
- [This](https://github.com/jthefox/portfolio-original) is the first portfolio that I built in HTML, CSS, and jQuery
- [Here](https://github.com/JtheFox/react-portfolio) is the second iteration, rebuilt with React and React Router
